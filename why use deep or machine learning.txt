The reason why to use machine learning is to get the rules 
required to get our desired output. For complex problems finding
the rules needed to get the output becomes a very tough job. for
example for a self driving car we will needed to make a real
complex set of rules for the car to self drive and not crash.

However when a problem is rather simple we should use a rule-based 
system rather then using machine learning.

when to use machine learning.

. problems with a really lost list of problem.
. when the enviroment is continously changing.
. getting insights in large collection of data.

when not to use machine learning
. when you need explainability - the pattern made by machine learning
is not understood by humans.
. when the traditional rule is a better option.
. when the error are not acceptable.
. when you do not have much data.
(but we can still use ML without a lot of data)

machine learning works on structured data like excel sheets but we know that
deep learning works better on unstructured data. Like videos, audio and etc.
