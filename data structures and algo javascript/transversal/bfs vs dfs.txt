//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
BFS(DFS WILL TAKE A LONG TIME)
//If the tree is very wide:
DFS(BFS WILL NEED TO MUCH MEMORY)
//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS
//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS
//Finding the shortest path:
BFS
