Tensorflow will help us build the deep learning model architecture.
It is a 
. end-to-end platform for machine learning
. write fast deep learning code in python.
. Able to use pre-existing deep learning models
. Whole stack: pre-process data,model data,deploy model in your application.
. Originally made by google and now is open source.

Why use tensorflow?
The answer is simple. works that would have taken months with large team to solve
few years ago just need a few lines of code nowadays with the help of the tensorflow.
 
GPU/TPU:-
graphical processing unit and Tensor processing unit.
we use them because they are good with numbers and can do mathmatical calculation 
really fast.
