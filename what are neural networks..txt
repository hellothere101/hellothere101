Let us explain neural network in a simpler way .
Let us consider  inputs or data and based on those input we 
will convert them into number(This conversion is called  numerical encoding).
now we will put the inputs to the neural network and based on these number 
neural network will try to find patterns in them in them.Finally the neural
network will find give us the output representation of the input data.
these output respresentation are the numeric representation of data and 
the relationship that exists between them.we will convert the outputs
representation to human understandable language. 

example of his usage are :
suppose we need to see the text send by the tweet and decide whether the tweet is 
acceptable or not. we will give the input to neural network and it will 
hopefully able to tell if the text send is correct or not.  

anatomy of the neural networks. 

input layer - where the data goes

hidden layer - where the pattern are learned

output layer - output learn the representation or prediction probabilities.

Types of learning

supervised learning - here the label and the data is given.

semi-supervised learning - has some or same data as supervised but only 
has some label 

unsupervised learning - only data but has no data.

Transfer learning - patterns learned in one deep learning model and use it in other 
deep learning model
