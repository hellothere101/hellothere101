we need to know what deep learning is first to know what deep learning is.
Machine learning is turning data numbers and finding patterns in the those numbers.
deep learning can be simply put as the subset of machine learning.
basically deep learning teaches computer to do what naturally comes to human.

traditional programming           vs              machine learning

here we have the input                         compare to traditional programming
and we follow the basic                        we try to give out inputs and outputs   
rules to get our desired                       to the computer first which will
output.                                        provide us with the set of rules needed
                                               to reach our output..
