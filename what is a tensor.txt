Tensor are the numeric representation of input or data we use.
without tensor we will not able to represent the data and make patterns from it.
To get a better understanding let us undestand what are vectors .
It is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. It can also represent area.
Now we will calculate the component of the vector on the x,y,z axis.
Tensor give  a perspective which will be the same for a observer and will not
change at all. hence called the facts of the universe.
